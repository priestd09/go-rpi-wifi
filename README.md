# go-rpi-wifi

A utility to help RaspberryPis connect to nearby wifi networks

## Synopsis

Anytime your raspberry pi is out of wifi range and cannot establish a outbound wifi connection, this utility will detect this and advertise the pi as an access point. This will be connectable via a WEP-style password, after which all traffic will be routed to a static page which shows nearby wifi access points. Choose the one from the list, enter the password if needed and viola!
